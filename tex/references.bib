	abstract = {A homomorphic encryption scheme is one that allows computing on encrypted data without decrypting it first. In fully homomorphic encryption it is possible to apply any efficiently computable function to encrypted data. We provide a survey on the origins, definitions, properties, constructions and uses of fully homomorphic encryption. 1 Homomorphic Encryption: Good, Bad or Ugly? In the seminal {RSA} cryptosystem [{RSA}78], the public key consists of a product of two primes N = p · q as well as an integer e, and the message space is the set of elements in {ZN} . Encrypting a message m involved simply raising it to the power e and taking the result modulo N , i.e. c = me (mod N). For the purpose of the current discussion we ignore the decryption process. It is not hard to see that the product of two ciphertexts c1 and c2 encrypting messages m1 and m2 allows to compute the value c1 · c2 (mod N) = (m1m2) (mod N), i.e. to compute an encryption of m1 · m2 without knowledge of the secret private key. Rabin’s cryptosystem [Rab79] exhibited similar behavior, where a product of ciphertexts corresponded to an encryption of their respective plaintexts. This behavior can be expressed in formal terms by saying that the ciphertext space and the plaintext space are homomorphic (multiplicative) groups. The decryption process defines the homomorphism by mapping a ciphertext to its image plaintext. Rivest, Adleman and Dertouzos [{RAD}78] realized the potential advantage of this property. In a time where complex computations required “buying computing cycles” from a mainframe computer maintained by an external company, one would be exposed to the danger of their private information being revealed to the vendor of computing power. However, if the computation only involves group operations on the input data, then homomorphism will allow the vendor to perform the computation on the ciphertext, rather than the plaintext, so that sensitive data is not revealed on one hand, and the heavy computational load is outsourced to the vendor on the other. Remarkably, 40 years down the line, outsourcing computation gained popularity once again with the introduction of cloud computing. Indeed, privacy in the era of the cloud is one of the most fascinating topics in modern cryptographic research. Naturally, one would like to extend homomorphism beyond group operations, and indeed [{RAD}78] put forth the question whether there exist encryption schemes that are homomorphic also with respect to ring (or field) operations, which would allow to perform arbitrary computation on the input data. ∗Weizmann Institute of Science, zvika.brakerski@weizmann.ac.il.

	title = {A fully homomorphic encryption scheme},
	url = {http://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf},
	abstract = {We propose the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme, solving an old open problem. Such a scheme allows one to compute arbitrary functions over encrypted data without the decryption key—i.e., given encryptions E(m1), ..., E( mt) of m1, ..., m t, one can efficiently compute a compact ciphertext that encrypts f(m1, ..., m t) for any efficiently computable function f.
Fully homomorphic encryption has numerous applications. For example, it enables encrypted search engine queries—i.e., a search engine can give you a succinct encrypted answer to your (boolean) query without even knowing what your query was. It also enables searching on encrypted data; you can store your encrypted data on a remote server, and later have the server retrieve only files that (when decrypted) satisfy some boolean constraint, even though the server cannot decrypt the files on its own. More broadly, it improves the efficiency of secure multiparty computation.
In our solution, we begin by designing a somewhat homomorphic "boostrappable" encryption scheme that works when the function f is the scheme's own decryption function. We then show how, through recursive self-embedding, bootstrappable encryption gives fully homomorphic encryption.},

	abstract = {This work describes a fast fully homomorphic encryption scheme over the torus ({TFHE}) that revisits, generalizes and improves the fully homomorphic encryption ({FHE}) based on {GSW} and its ring variants. The simplest {FHE} schemes consist in bootstrapped binary gates. In this gate bootstrapping mode, we show that the scheme {FHEW} of Ducas and Micciancio (Eurocrypt, 2015) can be expressed only in terms of external product between a {GSW} and an {LWE} ciphertext. As a consequence of this result and of other optimizations, we decrease the running time of their bootstrapping from 690 to 13 ms single core, using 16 {MB} bootstrapping key instead of 1 {GB}, and preserving the security parameter. In leveled homomorphic mode, we propose two methods to manipulate packed data, in order to decrease the ciphertext expansion and to optimize the evaluation of lookup tables and arbitrary functions in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{RingGSW}\}\}\$\$-based homomorphic schemes. We also extend the automata logic, introduced in Gama et al. (Eurocrypt, 2016), to the efficient leveled evaluation of weighted automata, and present a new homomorphic counter called \$\${\textbackslash}mathrm \{{TBSR}\}\$\$, that supports all the elementary operations that occur in a multiplication. These improvements speed up the evaluation of most arithmetic functions in a packed leveled mode, with a noise overhead that remains additive. We finally present a new circuit bootstrapping that converts \$\${\textbackslash}mathsf \{{LWE}\}\$\$ ciphertexts into low-noise \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{{RingGSW}\}\}\$\$ ciphertexts in just 137 ms, which makes the leveled mode of {TFHE} composable and which is fast enough to speed up arithmetic functions, compared to the gate bootstrapping approach. Finally, we provide an alternative practical analysis of {LWE} based schemes, which directly relates the security parameter to the error rate of {LWE} and the entropy of the {LWE} secret key, and we propose concrete parameter sets and timing comparison for all our constructions.},

Since the results of calculations remain encrypted and can only be decrypted by the data owner, confidentiality is guaranteed and any third party can operate on ciphertexts without access to decrypted data (plaintexts). Applying a homomorphic cryptosystem in a real-world application depends on its resource efficiency. Several works compared different {HE} schemes and gave the stakes of this research field. However, the existing works either do not deal with recently proposed {HE} schemes (such as {CKKS}) or focus only on one type of {HE}. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparison and evaluation of homomorphic cryptosystems’ performance based on their experimental results. The study covers all three families of {HE}, including several notable schemes such as {BFV}, {BGV}, {FHEW}, {TFHE}, {CKKS}, {RSA}, El-Gamal, and Paillier, as well as their implementation specification in widely used {HE} libraries, namely Microsoft {SEAL}, {PALISADE}, and {HElib}. In addition, we also discuss the resilience of {HE} schemes to different kind of attacks such as indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack and integer factorization attacks on classical and quantum computers.},

For {RLWE}, we have:• A leveled {FHE} scheme that can evaluate L-level arithmetic circuits with Õ(λ · L3) per-gate computation -- i.e., computation quasi-linear in the security parameter. Security is based on {RLWE} for an approximation factor exponential in L. This construction does not use the bootstrapping procedure.• A leveled {FHE} scheme that uses bootstrapping as an optimization, where the per-gate computation (which includes the bootstrapping procedure) is Õ(λ2), independent of L. Security is based on the hardness of {RLWE} for quasi-polynomial factors (as opposed to the sub-exponential factors needed in previous schemes).We obtain similar results to the above for {LWE}, but with worse performance.Based on the Ring {LWE} assumption, we introduce a number of further optimizations to our schemes. As an example, for circuits of large width -- e.g., where a constant fraction of levels have width at least λ -- we can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version to Õ(λ), independent of L, by batching the bootstrapping operation. Previous {FHE} schemes all required Ω(λ3.5) computation per gate.At the core of our construction is a much more effective approach for managing the noise level of lattice-based ciphertexts as homomorphic operations are performed, using some new techniques recently introduced by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan ({FOCS} 2011).},

It supports an approximate addition and multiplication of encrypted messages, together with a new rescaling procedure for managing the magnitude of plaintext. This procedure truncates a ciphertext into a smaller modulus, which leads to rounding of plaintext. The main idea is to add a noise following significant figures which contain a main message. This noise is originally added to the plaintext for security, but considered to be a part of error occurring during approximate computations that is reduced along with plaintext by rescaling. As a result, our decryption structure outputs an approximate value of plaintext with a predetermined precision.},

The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of {LWE}. A main open question was whether {LWE} and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).},

This learning problem is a natural extension of the 'learning from parity with error' problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for {SVP} and {SIVP}. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical.Using the main result, we obtain a public-key cryptosystem whose hardness is based on the worst-case quantum hardness of {SVP} and {SIVP}. Previous lattice-based public-key cryptosystems such as the one by Ajtai and Dwork were only based on unique-{SVP}, a special case of {SVP}. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous cryptosystems: the public key is of size Õ(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by Õ(n)(in previous cryptosystems these values are Õ(n4) and Õ(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length Õ(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to Õ(n).},

More precisely, we explain in this paper how we apply {FHE} to tree-based models and get state-of-the-art solutions over encrypted tabular data. We show that our method is applicable to a wide range of tree-based models, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosted trees, and has been implemented within the Concrete-{ML} library, which is open-source at https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml.

	abstract = {The {CoNLL}-03 corpus is arguably the most well-known and utilized benchmark dataset for named entity recognition ({NER}). However, prior works found significant numbers of annotation errors, incompleteness, and inconsistencies in the data. This poses challenges to objectively comparing {NER} approaches and analyzing their errors, as current state-of-the-art models achieve F1-scores that are comparable to or even exceed the estimated noise level in {CoNLL}-03. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive relabeling effort assisted by automatic consistency checking that corrects 7.0\% of all labels in the English {CoNLL}-03. Our effort adds a layer of entity linking annotation both for better explainability of {NER} labels and as additional safeguard of annotation quality. Our experimental evaluation finds not only that state-of-the-art approaches reach significantly higher F1-scores (97.1\%) on our data, but crucially that the share of correct predictions falsely counted as errors due to annotation noise drops from 47\% to 6\%. This indicates that our resource is well suited to analyze the remaining errors made by state-of-the-art models, and that the theoretical upper bound even on high resource, coarse-grained {NER} is not yet reached. To facilitate such analysis, we make {CLEANCONLL} publicly available to the research community1.},
